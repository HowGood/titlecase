Titlecase
=========

Titlecase is a port of John Gruber's titlecase.pl
http://daringfireball.net/2008/05/title_case

This filter changes all words to Title Caps, and attempts to be clever
about *un*\capitalizing SMALL words like a/an/the in the input.

The list of "SMALL words" which are not capped comes from
the New York Times Manual of Style, plus 'vs' and 'v'.

Usage
=====


To use it is as simple as:

>>> from titlecase import titlecase
>>> titlecase('a thing')
'A Thing'
